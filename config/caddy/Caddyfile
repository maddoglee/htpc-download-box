# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

:80 {
        # Set this path to your site's directory.
        root * /usr/share/caddy

        # Enable the static file server.
        file_server

        # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
        # reverse_proxy localhost:8080

        # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
        # php_fastcgi localhost:9000
}

#http://192.168.1.16 {
#    reverse_proxy 172.18.0.2:8080 {
#        header_up Host {host}
#        header_up X-Real-IP {remote}
#        header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote}
#        header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
#    }
#}

http://prowlarr.local {
    reverse_proxy prowlarr:9696 {
    }
}
